# Agentic Comparisons

Welcome to the **Agentic Comparisons** repository! This project explores how different agentic coding assistants, like Claude and Codex, handle identical prompts. The main goal is to evaluate their approaches to coding, UI/UX decisions, and the technology stacks they prefer.

## Overview
The repository is structured to provide a direct comparison between the outputs of Claude and Codex for various tasks. Each task is represented by a dedicated subdirectory that contains the deliverables and code generated by these assistants. By analyzing their outcomes, we aim to uncover their strengths, weaknesses, and unique approaches to solving problems.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into task-based subdirectories, each containing two folders: one for Claude's outputs and one for Codex's outputs. Below is the directory structure:

```
agentic-comparisons/
│
├── CCAP-Claude/      # Claude's implementation for task: CCAP
├── CCAP-Codex/       # Codex's implementation for task: CCAP
│
├── HMS-Claude/       # Claude's implementation for task: HMS
├── HMS-Codex/        # Codex's implementation for task: HMS
│
├── ISD-Claude/       # Claude's implementation for task: ISD
├── ISD-Codex/        # Codex's implementation for task: ISD
│
├── WebOS-Claude/     # Claude's implementation for task: WebOS
├── WebOS-Codex/      # Codex's implementation for task: WebOS
```

Each task is represented by its acronym (e.g., CCAP, HMS, ISD, WebOS). Both Claude's and Codex's outputs are stored in separate subdirectories for clarity and ease of comparison.

## Goals
The primary objectives of this repository are:

1. **Code Analysis**: Compare the coding styles, logic, and efficiency of Claude and Codex.
2. **UI/UX Evaluation**: Assess the user interface and experience decisions made by each assistant.
3. **Stack Comparison**: Identify the technologies and frameworks chosen by each assistant to solve the same problem.

## How to Use This Repository
1. **Explore the Code**: Navigate to the subdirectories for each task to review and analyze the outputs of Claude and Codex.
2. **Compare Outputs**: Directly compare the solutions provided by both assistants for the same task.
3. **Draw Insights**: Use the comparisons to understand the unique strengths and preferences of each coding assistant.
