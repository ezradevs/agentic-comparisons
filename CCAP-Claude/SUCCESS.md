## 🐛 Known Issues / Notes

1. **Port 3001 Instead of 3000**
   - Port 3000 was in use, so the app runs on 3001
   - This is normal and fine for development
   - To use 3000, stop the other process on that port

2. **Turbopack Warning**
   - The lockfile warning is harmless
   - It's just Next.js detecting parent directory lockfile
   - Doesn't affect functionality

---

## 🆘 If Something Doesn't Work

**Server won't start:**
```bash
# Kill the background process
# Find and kill process on port 3000/3001
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9

# Clear cache and restart
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

**Database issues:**
```bash
# Regenerate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# Reset database
rm prisma/dev.db
npx prisma db push
npm run db:seed
```

**Login not working:**
- Ensure database is seeded: `npm run db:seed`
- Check credentials: `admin@chessclub.com` / `admin123`
- Clear browser cookies and try again
