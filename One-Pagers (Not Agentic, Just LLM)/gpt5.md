I built you a sleek, print-ready resume/personal dashboard as a single React + Tailwind component (in the canvas). It’s dark-mode aware, subtly animated, and designed to fit nicely on an A4 when you “Save as PDF.”

How to customise:

* Edit the `profile`, `skills`, `projects`, `experience`, `education`, and `awards` objects at the top.
* Click “Save as PDF” (button in the top-right) to print/export.
* Swap icons/links or add sections by duplicating a `<Section>` block.

Want it as plain HTML/CSS instead, or prefer a different color vibe/section layout? Tell me your style (e.g., “electric blue accent” or “sidebar + timeline”), and I’ll spin that version too.
